# spark_utils

Welcome to `spark_utils`, a collection of utility functions for making PySpark development easier, faster, and cleaner! ðŸš€

## Why Spark Utils?

`spark_utils` is a dedicated module to house all those handy functions that you find yourself writing over and over again. By centralizing these utilities, you can:

- **Avoid Namespace Pollution**: Keep your PySpark functions separate from your general Python functions, avoiding any pesky name collisions.
- **Enhance Readability**: Clearly distinguish between your PySpark-specific logic and the rest of your codebase.
- **Boost Reusability**: Write once, use anywhere. Reuse common data transformations, I/O operations, and more across your projects.
- **Simplify Maintenance**: Update and manage your utilities in one place, making your life as a developer a whole lot easier.
- **Improve Performance**: Apply best practices consistently, optimizing your Spark jobs without breaking a sweat.

## What's Inside?

Our `spark_utils` module is packed with useful functions for common PySpark tasks. Here's a sneak peek at some of the goodies you'll find:

### Available Now:
- **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)**: Essential tools to help you understand and explore your data quickly and efficiently.

### Coming Soon:
- **Data Transformations**: Functions to filter, select, and rename columns effortlessly.
- **I/O Operations**: Simplified read/write operations to and from various data sources.
- **Schema Management**: Handy utilities for defining and validating schemas.
- **Error Handling**: Standardized error handling and logging practices to keep your pipelines robust.
